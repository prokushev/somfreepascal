Another somFree incompatabilities

1. somEnvironmentNew raises exception if call twice under somFree, but OK in IBM SOM 2.1 and 3.0
2. Base classes in SOM.DLL preconstructered. So, trick of VPSOM with memory allocation functions doesn't work,
Need another solution... Problem occurs on all versions of SOM. (Solution mostly found. Need extra checks in
code and testing). For example, prevent destroing of such SOM objects because Pascal classes doesn't handle them...
