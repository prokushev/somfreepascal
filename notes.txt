Need some investigation about CORBA memory management.

CORBA_*_alloc
CORBA_free
CORBA_*_set_release
CORBA_*_get_release

Seems CORBA_free and ORBFree have a similar idea... But I still can't find info about DSOM alloc and set/get release flag...


New for somFree

CORBA memory management functions are implemented, such as:

CORBA_T_alloc
CORBA_free
CORBA_T_set_release
CORBA_T_get_release


CORBA::LocalObject

LocalObject is mostly just SOMObject...
